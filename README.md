# WinScripts
Windows Batch/PS/Shell Scripting


### [Git wrapper](https://github.com/maxwroc/WinScripts/blob/master/batch/git-wrapper.bat)
Features:
* Extends git branch listings with numbers, allowing you to chose branch without need of typing the full name. 
* Shows current branch, highlighted in green, on the beginning of the command prompt.
* Prevents from unintentional branch creating based on current one (asks for confirmation)

**Note:** Once applied it replaces the "git" command. If you want to use Git binary directly type git.exe

**Note:** Colors work only on Windows 10
